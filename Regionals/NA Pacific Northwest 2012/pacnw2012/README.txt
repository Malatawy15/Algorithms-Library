The folders in this zip file contain the following for each problem in
the contest:

1) Problem solutions in at least java and c++, named as: Problem.java
   and Problem.cpp
   NOTE: there are some alternate solutions included as well that may
   be less efficient, etc.
2) Official input and output: Problem.in and Problem.out
3) Sample input and output (from problem statement): Problem.sample.in or out
4) .tex file of problem statement
5) makefile for compilation and execution of solutions
6) validators for problems that required it
7) data generators for some problems
8) perl scripts to help validate input format and overall cleanliness

The problem writers worked extremely hard to build a clear, concise, and
clean problem set.  They sincerely hope you enjoyed the results of their
efforts and found their work challenging, fun, and educational.

...next year they will boldly go where no PacNW problem set has gone before ;-)
